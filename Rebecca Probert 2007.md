# 📌 Main Argument (3–5 sentences)
- Probert argues that although the Law Commission’s scheme for reforming the financial consequences of cohabitation breakdown aims to provide fairness, its design contains major internal inconsistencies and practical weaknesses. Domestic contributions are undervalued; the definition of “contribution” shifts depending on whether the claim is for retained benefit or economic disadvantage; and the scheme excludes many forms of sacrifice commonly made within cohabiting relationships. She warns that measuring economic disadvantage is extremely difficult in practice, and many cohabitants may receive less protection than under existing constructive trust principles. While the case for reform is strong, the proposed model risks creating new injustices while failing to fix the old ones.

# 🧠 Key Points / Thesis
- Current property law is imperfect but predictable; the Law Commission’s scheme may be more confusing.
- Domestic contributions often excluded from “retained benefit”, even though they generate value.
- Measuring “economic disadvantage” is difficult and could lead to inconsistent results.
- Some cohabitants may fare *worse* under the new scheme than under CICT.
- Opt-out system risks couples mistakenly thinking they opted out when they haven’t.
- Reform must recognise diversity of cohabiting relationships; one-size-fits-all rules are risky.

# 🔍 How to Use in IRAC (Exam Use)
## Issue
 - Whether statutory reform is needed to replace constructive trusts.
- Whether CICT is unfair to cohabiting partners (often women).


## Rule
- Use Probert to critique the Law Commission proposals as too narrow and inconsistent.
- Use as a counterpoint to scholars (e.g., Miles) demanding broader 
## Application
- Argue that the Law Commission undervalues domestic labour and indirect contributions.
- Show that economic disadvantage is extremely hard to measure fairly.
- Use quotes to emphasise that new scheme may leave claimants worse off.

## Conclusion
- Reform is necessary but must be carefully designed; the Law Commission’s proposal is not yet adequate.
