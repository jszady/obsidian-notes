# Facts
- Council tenants (the Lees) lived in accommodation with **severe damp and mould**.
- The damp was caused by **inherent structural defects**, including:
    
    - poor insulation
    - thick concrete walls
    - cold bridging
    - lack of proper ventilation
- The tenants argued this breached the landlord’s **repairing duty** under s11 LTA 1985.
- They also argued there should be a positive duty under **Article 8 ECHR** (right to home and family life).

## Issue
- Does damp/mould caused by **structural design** amount to “disrepair” under s11?
- Does Article 8 ECHR impose a duty on councils to ensure homes are free from hazardous damp?

## Decision

- **NO disrepair** under s11 — because the problem arose from **structural design**, not deterioration.
- **NO Article 8 duty** to remedy such defects
## Reasoning

### 1. Structural defects ≠ disrepair

The building:

- was poorly insulated,
- prone to condensation,
- inherently flawed in its design.

But the walls, structure, and installations had **not deteriorated**.

Therefore:

 - **This is an inherent defect, not disrepair.**  
-  (Same reasoning as [[Quick v Taff-Ely BC]] and [[Post Office v Aquarius]])

###  2. s11 applies only to deterioration

- Landlords must fix _deterioration_, not cure architectural problems.
- Improving insulation or redesigning the building would be an **upgrade**, not a repair.

###  3. No ECHR-based repairing obligation

- Claimants argued Article 8 should require councils to maintain homes in a decent, liveable condition.

- Court rejected this:
	- Article 8 does **not** create positive repairing duties.
	- It only prevents unlawful eviction or interference — not impose improvement duties.
## Ratio
- **Landlords are not liable under s11 for damp or condensation caused by inherent structural defects.**  
- Article 8 ECHR does not impose a duty to fix such issues
