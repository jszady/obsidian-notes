# Facts

- Camelot was a **property guardian company** managing vacant properties.
- Khoo occupied a **private room** in a former residential home.
- The agreement labelled him a **“licensee.”**
- He had **exclusive possession of his own room** (he kept a key).
- All occupiers shared **common spaces** (kitchen, bathrooms, hallways).
- The operator controlled:
    - cleaning and maintenance of shared areas
    - rules for use of communal facilities
    - overall building management
- Camelot did **not** interfere with each occupier’s private room.
- Khoo argued he had a **tenancy of the entire premises**, claiming a joint tenancy with all occupiers.
## Issue
Did the arrangement create:

- a **joint tenancy** over the entire building,
- a **lease of Khoo’s individual room**,  
    or
- a **mere licence**?

## Decision
The Court of Appeal held:

- Khoo held **exclusive possession of his own room**  **lease of that room**
- BUT he held only a **licence** over shared/common areas
- There was **no joint tenancy** over the entire building

## Reasoning
### 1. Exclusive possession limited to a **specific room**

Khoo had:

- his own key
- no one else could enter
- genuine control over the room

- This granted **exclusive possession** of that room.

###  2. Communal areas did **not** grant exclusive possession

Because:

- multiple occupiers used them
- Camelot retained control & access
- maintenance and cleaning were managed by the operator

-  This part of the arrangement was a **licence**.

###  3. No joint tenancy theory

The occupiers:

- did NOT sign at the same time
- had separate agreements
- had no collective rights over the building

- Matches reasoning of **[[AG Securities v Vaughan]]** — no unity of time/title → NO joint tenancy.

###  4. Valid dual-structure agreement

- The court confirmed this modern structure is **legally acceptable**:

- **Separate leases for rooms + licence for shared parts**   is a valid way to structure HMOs, guardianships, and shared housing.

## Ratio
- Granting exclusive possession of an individual room creates a **lease of that room**, even in guardian/HMO/shared housing.  
- Shared areas remain under **licence**, and no joint tenancy arises unless the four unities are present.
