# Trustee Act 1925

## Key Section

- **s.34(2):** When land is held by co-owners, the **maximum number of legal owners** is four.  
    Any additional persons hold only equitable (beneficial) interests under a trust.

## Purpose / Context

Prevents administrative problems by limiting legal co-ownership.  
Ensures co-owned land is automatically held under a **trust of land**.

## Interpretation Notes

- The first four named owners on a transfer deed become the legal owners (trustees).
- Disputes between co-owners are handled under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (TOLATA).
