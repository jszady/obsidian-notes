## Key Section

- **s.23:** For _unregistered land_, the root of title is proved by producing title deeds showing at least **15 years** of continuous ownership (previously 30 years).
## Purpose / Context

Simplifies conveyancing in unregistered land by shortening how far back title deeds must be shown.  
Supports proof of ownership where registration has not yet occurred.

## Interpretation Notes

- Works together with _[[LPA 1925]]s52 (deed requirement) — the deed provides the “root of title.”
- If deeds are missing, **adverse possession** evidence may suffice (after 12 years).
