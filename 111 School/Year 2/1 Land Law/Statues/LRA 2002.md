# Land Registration Act 2002

## Key Sections

- **s.4:** Registration is compulsory when:
    - a freehold or leasehold estate is sold, gifted, or mortgaged; or
    - a lease exceeding 7 years is granted.
- **s.27(1):** Legal title to land does _not_ pass until the transfer is registered.
- **s.32:** Allows registration of _notices_ to protect equitable interests.
- **Schedule 3:** Lists _overriding interests_ that bind purchasers even if unregistered (e.g., rights of those in actual occupation).

## Purpose / Context

Modernised and digitised the Land Registry system.  
Shifted England from a deeds-based to a registration-based model of ownership.

## Interpretation Notes

- Registration = proof of ownership (mirror principle).
- _Overriding interests_ ensure fairness for unregistered occupiers.
- Works alongside _LPA 1925 s52_ (deed required before registration).
