- Problem Question 
	1. **Issue**: Whether Kinmont has acquired title to the Strip by **adverse possession** under the **Land Registration Act 2002**, given his occupation from July 2014–2025.
	2. **Relevant test** (JA _Pye v Graham_):  
	    Must show **(1) factual possession** + **(2) intention to possess** + **(3) without owner’s consent** for **10 years** (LRA 2002, Sch 6).
	3. **Factual possession** present:
	    - Grazing livestock,
	    - Replacing wall with wire fence,
	    - Erecting two livestock sheds,  
	        → Strong physical control and exclusivity.
	4. **Intention to possess** clear:
	    - Fencing off land,
	    - Building structures,
	    - Treating land as his own.  
	        → Classic _Pye_ intention: possession “to the exclusion of the world.”
	5. **Possession was adverse, not consensual**:
	    - Walter’s text (“not very happy… keep them under control”) expresses disapproval, not permission.
	    - No licence or consent granted → does **not** defeat adverse possession.
	6. **Time requirement is satisfied**:
	    - July 2014 to (at least) August 2025 = **11 years** of adverse possession.
	    - Meets the **10-year** requirement before applying to the Land Registry.
	7. **Under LRA 2002**, Kinmont must apply to be registered.
	    - Registry notifies Elliott (current owner)
	    - Elliott can **object** and normally defeat the claim **unless** a statutory exception applies.
	8. **Main exception available: Reasonable mistaken boundary belief** (Sch 6 para 5(4)(b)):
	    - Estate Manager told Kinmont that the **river** was the boundary.
	    - He relied on this when fencing and building sheds.
	    - This looks like a **classic boundary mistake**, and the belief appears **reasonable**.
	9. **Other exceptions are weaker**:
	    - Proprietary estoppel possible but evidence limited.
	    - Equity via unconscionability also arguable but not as strong as boundary mistake.
	10. **Did Elliott’s actions in 2025 break possession?**
		- Elliott removed fence, herded livestock away, put up signs.
		- But Kinmont had sheds still on the land + a long history of control.
		- Short two-week holiday does **not** equal abandonment.  
		    → Possession was interfered with but likely **not fully ousted**.
	11. **Most likely legal conclusion**:
		- Kinmont **has** the 10 years.    
		- He has **strong factual + intentional possession**.
		- Possession was **adverse** throughout.
		- He has a **credible boundary-mistake exception**, making him eligible to be registered **despite Elliott’s objection**.
	12. **Final outcome**:  
	    **Kinmont is likely to succeed** in an adverse possession application under LRA 2002 **via the boundary-mistake exception**, and should become the registered proprietor of the Strip.
