## Questions and Answers 

1. Question 1
	1. Exclusive possession (inferred or explicit)
	2. Are Jack and Beryl tenants (leases) or licensees
		1. Case law 
			1. [[Street v Mountford]] says the label licence is irrelevant what the courts really look for is exclusive possession + term certain that will be a lease 
			2. [[Antoniades v Villiers]] A right to enter clause is ignored if never used pretence meaning it will be a lease 
				1. there is differences in this as in Villiers case there is only 1 bedroom here there is 2 
			3. [[AG Securities v Vaughan]] separate agreements and different start times is not considered joint tenancy meaning it will be a licence 
		2. Application to facts of scenario
			1. Clauses says 
				1. not intended to create landlord and tenant relationship 
					1. this is irrelevant [[Street v Mountford]]
				2. licensor may from time to time occupy the property
					1. since the licensor (Henry) did not enter the property this would be an example of pretence since it has an air of total unreality [[Antoniades v Villiers]] 
			2. Jack and Beryl moved in the same day under the same agreement which strongly mirrors [[Antoniades v Villiers]]
			3. They share the common areas 
			4. there is a term certain of 12-months
	3. Repair and Habitability 
		1. the mouldy patchers growing on his armchair seem to be a defect since condensation started growing under the windowsill and not deterioration meaning this would fail under [[LTA 1985]] s11
			1. this section makes landlords fix physical deterioration 
			2. it does not extend to fixing problems caused by the building design
		2. but under [[LTA 1985]] s9A this could breach the fitness standard making the room not reasonably suited for occupancy [[jojo hall v manchester]], [[jones v green]], 
		3. The issue here lies with jack since he needs to notify Henry [[O'Brien v Robinson]]
	4. Landlord conduct 
		1. since Henry warned Jack by saying "i hope your not argumentative ive got plenty of people ready to take a property like this"
			1. This may discourage Jack from complaining
			2. if tenant complains to local authorities and a repair notice is served and s21 eviction notice is invalid for 6 months this is true under [[Deregulation Act 2015]]
			3. again the issue here is jack never complained  
2. Question 2
	1. The homes Act 2018 
		1. The _Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018_ and proposals to abolish _s 21 Housing Act 1988_ place **excessive and uncertain burdens on private landlords**.
		2. the homes Act 2018 imposes too great an obligation
			1. it widened liability on disrepair 
				1. before 2018 duty under [[LTA 1985]] s11 was limed to deterioration 
				2. [[LTA 1985]] s9A-C now required landlords to ensure premises are fit for human habitation al all times even without deterioration 
			2. Vague legal test 
				1. no clear benchmark for what is reasonably suitable for occupation
			3. Financial problems 
				1. landlords may lack funds to meet new heating insulation standards 
		3. abolishing s 21 no fault is problematic 
			1. **s 21 Housing Act 1988** gives landlords flexibility to regain possession after the fixed term without proving fault.
				1. Removing it limits their ability to sell, house family members, or manage risk of rent arrears
