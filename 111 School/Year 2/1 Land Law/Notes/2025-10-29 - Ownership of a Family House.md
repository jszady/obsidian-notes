## Key Points
- Why this topic exists
	1. The common law marriage myth 
		- People believe that if we live together long enough I get rights like a married spouse 
		- this is false in English Law
			- if a home is in one persons name the other partner has no automatic share 
			- even after 5,10,20 years 
			- even if they raised children 
			- even if they pay bills 
		- the non owner must prove trust or proprietary estoppel 
	2. Why disputes happen 
		- must couples 
			- Don't formally agree ownership 
			- Don't put both names on the title
			- Don't write a declaration of trust 
			- Pool their money informally 
			- One partner sacrifices career to raise children
	3. Why this is a women's rights issue 
		- women more often give up work lose earning potential 
		- they don't gain property rights automatically 
		- courts need a way to compensate non-financial contributions
		- **this is why constructive trusts and estoppel exists** 
- The Legal Structure of Ownership 
	- there are 3 ways a partner can own rights in a house 
		- Joint legal ownership (Both names on title)
		- Single legal Ownership (One name on title)
		- Proprietary Estoppel (promises + reliance)
- Joint Legal Ownership (JLO)
	- Default rule 
		- Equity follows the law if both names are on the legal title both are presumed 50/50 beneficial owners 
	- Case law 
		- [[Stack v Dowden]]
		- [[Jones v Kernott]]
	1. How to rebut the 50/50 presumption
		- The stack factors (from house of lords): [[Stack v Dowden]]
			- whether finances were shared 
			- whether the couple treated assets as joint 
			- who paid mortgage 
			- who paid deposit 
			- who paid major children 
			- whether finances were kept rigidly separate 
			- intentions expressed during purchase
				- if evidence shows they did not intend 50/50 courts may adjust shares 
		- Example 
			- Amy and Ben buy a house as joint legal owners but:
				- Amy paid the entire deposit
				- Amy paid 75% of mortgage 
				- they kept separate bank accounts 
				- Ben made very little contribution 
					- courts may say Amy gets 65-75% Ben gets 25-35%
				But 
				- if ben sacrificed career to raise their child and Amy worked shares may be different
	2. Quantifications (how shares are divided)
		- If the courts finds the intention was NOT 50/50 but the exact shares are unclear:
			- the courts can impute a fair share [[Jones v Kernott]]
				- Impute = courts can decide what is fair 
- Single Legal Ownership (SLO)
	- this is the most complex and important section 
	- all exam problems will come from here
	- if the house is in A's name only B must prove a beneficial interest through: 
		- Express trust 
		- Resulting trust 
		- Constructive trust (CICT) <- most important
		- Proprietary Estoppel
	1. Express Trust 
		- [[LPA 1925]] s53(1)(b)
		- a owns 70% b owns 30%
			- this is conclusive 
		- Courts cannot change that [[Stack v Dowden]] , [[Jones v Kernott]]
		- if not writing it moves to trust 
	2. Resulting Trust (this is a old doctrine)
		- Rule:
			- Beneficial interest arise if partner made a direct financial contribution to the purchase price at the time of acquisition
		- Example:
			- Paying part of deposit 
			- Paying initial purchase money
			- Paying stamp duty or solicitor fees
		- Does not count for:
			- Bills 
			- Food
			- Childcare
			- Furniture 
			- Later mortgage payments [[Curley v Parkes]]
		- This method is rigid and sexist (favors the partner with money)
		- therefore rarely used today 
	3. Common Intention Constructive Trust (CICT) 
		- This requires 2 stages 
		1. Did the partner have a common intention to share the home
			- Route A Express Common Intention 
				- there was a verbal or written discussions about sharing the home 
				- Example:
					- This is our home 
					- You'll get a share when we sell 
					- We're building this life together 
				- Cases
					- [[Eves v Eves]] - I would put your name on it if you were older 
					- [[Grant v Edwards]] - I didn't put your name for legal reasons 
					- courts see these excuses as implied reassurance <- Beneficial interest
			- Route B Inferred common interest 
				- Courts deduces intention form conduct 
				- Classic test (strict)
					- Only direct contributions to purchase/mortgage count 
				- Cases
					- [[Lloyds Bank v Rosset]] (narrow test)
					- [[Burns v Burns]] (no interest for doing childcare/chores)
				- Modern Courts have widened it:
					- [[Stack v Dowden]]
					- [[Jones v Kernott]]
					- [[Abbott v Abbott]]
					- [[Oxley v Hiscock]]
					- [[Hampshire v Fox]]
				- Courts now consider 
					- Deposit 
					- Mortgage
					- Major Renovations 
					- Paying large household expenses that free up mortgage money 
					- Sacrificing work to raise children 
					- Running family business unpaid 
				- But [[Lloyds Bank v Rosset]] still applies especially where:
					- Contributions are indirect
					- Relationship is short
					- Evidence is weak 
				- 
		2. What are the shares (Quantifications)
			- If common intention is established courts decides shares:
			- Methods:
				- Express agreement <- Binding 
				- Inferred intention <- based on conduct 
				- Imputed intention <- Court decides what is Fair [[Jones v Kernott]]
			- Factors:
				- Length of relationship 
				- Children 
				- Who paid mortgage
				- Who paid bills
				- Who paid renovations 
				- Sacrifices made 
				- Separation of finances 
			- Example of (SLO) Single Legal Ownership:
				- House in A's name 
				- B paid:
					- no deposit 
					- no mortgage
					- but paid for childcare
					- paid all bills 
					- did 10 years house making 
				- under resulting trust 
					- b gets 0% 
				- Under CICT:
					- Courts likely finds shared intention 
					- Quantifies share (maybe 30-50%)
					- Using [[Stack v Dowden]], [[Jones v Kernott]]
				- This is why CICT exists
	4. Proprietary Estoppel 
		- Different form constructive trust 
		- this deals with promises 
		- from [[Thorner v Majors]] and [[Gillett v Holt]] 
			1. Assurance 
				- A promise or encouragement
				- This will be your home one day 
				- You'll inherit this property 
			2. Reliance 
				- Partner acts because of the promise 
				- e.g., works unpaid, gives up career, contributes money
			3. Detriment 
				- Sacrifices or losses suffered
				- e.g., works unpaid, gives up career, contributes money
			4. Unconscionability 
				- Would it be unfair not to grant rights 
		- Remedies (Flexible)
			- Cases:
				- [[Jennings v Rice]]
				- [[Guest v Guest]] (Supreme Court 2022)
			- Courts may grant 
				- Full ownership 
				- life interest 
				- money award
				- lesser share 
				- remedy proportional to determent

## Quotes 
- [[Joanna Miles 2003]] 
	- argues current trusts law treats cohabitants unfairly and needs hybrid reform.
