## Key Points

- What is the meaning of Land ?
	- Land can refer to both:
		- The physical land (surface, subsurface, structures, air space) and;
		- the legal rights associated with that land (ownership, lease, easement, etc.) ([[LPA 1925]] s205, defines land to include both physical land and interests in it)
	- **Physical Components**
		- **Subsurface**: extends as far down as human technology allows- [[Bocardo SA v Star Energy]]
		- **Surface**: Includes soil trees, and vegetation rooted in it
		- **Structures**: objects that are intended to form a part of the land [[Elitestone Ltd v Morris]]
			- Test to permanence (fixture) and intention distinguishes fixtures (part of land) from chattels (movable items)
		- **Airspace**: Extends to a reasonable height above the surface [[Bernstein v Skyviews & General Ltd]]
			- Not as high as where aircrafts travel
		- **Summary**: Owning land means owning both the physical area and the legal rights that come with it subject to statute and public law
- History of ownership ?
	- A Historical Context (Feudal Roots)

		- the crown granted rights to use land to nobles in exchange for services (soldiers)
		- People held "Estates" <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">temporary</mark> rights to the land

- Property Rights and Personal Rights 
	- Personal rights 
		- enforced only against the person who granted it 
		- this does not bind third parties 
		- **Contractual licence**: Permission given by contract to use land (to park car or occupy land for a certain time)
			- Ends automatically on sale of the land 
			- Remedies: damages or sometimes injunctions 
		- **Bare Licence:** Informal permission can be revoked anything (reasonable time to leave)
	- Property rights

			- Leasehold estates (exclusive possession for a term)
			- Easements (rights to use another's land)
			- Restrictive convents (promises limiting land use)
			- Mortgages (security for a loan)
			- Beneficial interests under trusts
			- Rights arising from proprietary estoppel
- How Property Rights Arise
	- Express Creation 
		- must
			- fit a recognised category of property rights and;
			- satisfy formalities (often deed or signed writing)
		- failure created only a personal right 
		- rarely courts may recognize new types [[Tulk v Moxhay (1848)]]
	- By Operation of Law 
		- arise automatically in specific circumstances
		- New types cannot be invented by course [[Provincial Bank v Ainsworth (1965)]] overruled [[Bendall v McWhirter (1952)]]
- Types of property rights 
	- **Leasehold Estate**
		- The right to exclusively possess and use someone else's land for a set period of time 
			- its basically renting but with a strong legal protection
		- Example: you rent a 12 month tenancy your landlord sells the building but your lease continues the new owner becomes your new landlord automatically 
		- **Key Case** : [[Street v Mountford]]
	- **Easement**
		- The right to use someones else's land for specific purpose
			- a shared right to do something on another persons property
		- Example: you own a house that's behind another property and your only access is through their driveway you will likely have an easement giving you a right of way 
		- **Key Case**: [[Re Ellenborough Park]]
	- Restrictive Covenant 
		- a promise that limits what you can do on your land made in favour of another land owner 
			- you have have the land but you cant do this 
		- Example: a developer builds a house on new land and adds a sign no owner may use this property for business purposes you sell your house the next owner must follow the same rule 
		- **Key Case**: [[Tulk v Moxhay[1848]]
	- Mortgage 
		- a Security interest 
			- you own the land but the bank holds a legal hook on it 
		- Example: you buy a house for 300k if you stop paying the band can repossess and sell the house to recover the debt 
		- Statute [[LPA 1925]] s87
	- Estate Contract 
		- A contract giving you the right to buy or lease land in the future 
			- a reservation you dont own it yet but you have a legal claim to it 
		- Example: a developer pays you for an option to but your land within the next 2 years if they decide to exercise that option you must sell to them at the agreed price 
		- **Statute**: [[LPA 1989]] s2
	- Equity by Estoppel 
		- a right that arises whens someone is promised land relies on that promise and it would be unfair to not enforce it 
			- the law stepping in to prevent unfairness
		- Example: a older made promised his worker that he will get the land when he dies the worker works for years to relying on that promise but when the man dies it not in the will the courts make give him shares of the land 
		- **Key Case**: [[Gillett v Holt [2001] ]]
