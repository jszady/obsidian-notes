# 📌 Main Argument (3–5 sentences)
- Miles argues that property law and family law are built on fundamentally different assumptions, and neither can, on its own, resolve the economic problems faced by home-sharing partners, particularly cohabitants. She critiques the Law Commission’s attempt to create a purely “property-law” contribution-based scheme, showing that it collapses when trying to account for domestic labour or relationship context. Miles demonstrates that property law’s focus on contributions and intention is inadequate to address gendered economic disadvantage, while family law’s discretionary model is too broad and status-based. She concludes that only a hybrid system  combining property and family law principles — can deliver fair outcomes.

# 🧠 Key Points / Thesis
- Property law is rigid, backward-looking, and ignores relationship context.  
- Family law is discretionary, forward-looking, and based on needs/status.  
-  The Law Commission’s contribution-based “Sharing Homes” scheme failed because contributions cannot capture relationship dynamics.
-  Barlow & Lind’s “modified community of property” offers a relational alternative, but still incomplete.  
- True reform must combine property rights (security) with family-law-style compensation and discretion.

# 🔍 How to Use in IRAC (Exam Use)
## Issue
- Whether CICT/resulting trusts fairly recognise domestic contributions and economic inequality.
- Whether current English law adequately protects cohabitants.

## Rule
-  Use Miles to critique **Rosset**, **Burns v Burns**, **Stack**, **Kernott**, and CICT doctrine.
- Cite her to attack the fiction of “intention” in constructive trusts.

## Application
- Argue that contribution-based property law under-values childcare/domestic work.  
- Argue that fairness is already being smuggled into CICT (Stack/Kernott).
- Use quotes to show the need for a hybrid regime.



## Conclusion
- The present system is fragmented and unfair; true reform needs a combined property–family approach.

# 📌 Context (Why this matters)
- Miles argues that property law’s rigid, contribution-focused approach and family law’s needs-based discretion each fail, on their own, to deal with the realities of cohabiting relationships. She concludes that only a hybrid, integrated approach can provide fair and coherent outcomes for modern families.
