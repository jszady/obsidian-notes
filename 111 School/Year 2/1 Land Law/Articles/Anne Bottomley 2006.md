# 📌 Main Argument (3–5 sentences)
- Bottomley argues that the popular feminist claim that property law fails cohabiting women (using _Mrs Burns_) is outdated, oversimplified, and risks pushing all relationships into a marriage-like regulatory model. She warns that reforms may help only a narrow group while reducing personal autonomy, and urges caution before extending family-law remedies to cohabitants.

# 🧠 Key Points / Thesis
- Reformers rely too heavily on **Mrs Burns** as the “victim” symbol justifying giving cohabitants marital-style rights.
- But **modern cohabitation patterns are far more diverse** — e.g., Mrs Oxley, who had resources, previous marriage, and different vulnerabilities.
- Property law has evolved (e.g., **Oxley v Hiscock**, estoppel, wider constructive trust factors). It **no longer leaves women as helpless as critics claim**.
- Extending marriage-style family law risks **forcing all relationships into State-regulated marriage norms**, decreasing choice.
- Emotional vulnerability and assumptions about “common-law marriage” often cause harm, not the law itself.
- Reform could be **symbolic**, benefiting only a small group, while **strengthening marriage as the default model for all relationships**.
