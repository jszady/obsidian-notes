# Facts

- A bungalow rested on concrete pillars but was not fixed to them. The question was whether it was part of the land or a separate chattel.

## Issue

- Was the bungalow a fixture (part of the land) or a chattel (personal property)?
## Decision

- It was a fixture forming part of the land.

## Reasoning

-  **Test of permanence and intention**:
    - If removal would destroy or damage it → part of the land.
    - If intended to remain permanently → fixture.
- The bungalow couldn’t be removed without destruction → part of the land.
## Ratio
- An object is part of the land if it is intended to remain permanently and is integral to the property’s use.

#### Exam use 

- Clarifies **fixture vs chattel** distinction.
