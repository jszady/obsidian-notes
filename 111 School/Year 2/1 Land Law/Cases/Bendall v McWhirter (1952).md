# Facts

- A wife living in the matrimonial home claimed a right to stay when her husband left and rented it to someone else.
## Issue

- Did she have a property right binding the new tenant?
## Decision

- No – she had only a personal right against her husband.
## Reasoning

- Mere occupation or permission doesn’t create a property right.
- Her claim was not registrable or enforceable against third parties.
## Ratio

- Occupancy without a legal or equitable interest does not amount to a **property right**.
#### Exam use 

- Shows **limits of personal rights**; overruled later by _Ainsworth_.
