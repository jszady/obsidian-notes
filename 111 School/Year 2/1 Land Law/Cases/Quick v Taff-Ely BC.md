# Facts
- The tenants lived in a council property owned by Taff-Ely Borough Council.
- The property suffered from **severe condensation and mould**, particularly during winter.
- The condensation was caused by the **design and construction** of the building:
    
    - poor insulation,
    - inadequate heating facilities,
    - cold walls and structural layout creating moisture issues.
- Tenants argued this amounted to **“disrepair”** under the repairing covenant (now [[LTA 1985]] s11).
- They claimed the landlord should improve the property to stop the condensation.

## Issue
- Does **condensation and mould caused by structural design** amount to **“disrepair”** under s11 LTA 1985?
- Or is it merely an **inherent defect** for which the landlord is not liable?

## Decision
The Court of Appeal held:

- **Condensation due to structural design is NOT “disrepair.”**
- The landlord was **not** liable under the repairing covenant.
- No obligation exists to **improve** the building or cure inherent defects.

## Reasoning
### 1. Disrepair = deterioration (applies **only** to things that get worse)

The court relied on the rule from **[[Post office v Aquarius]]**:

 - “Disrepair” requires deterioration from a previous physical condition.

In this case:

- the walls, windows, roof, etc., were **not deteriorating**;
- they simply had **poor thermal performance** from the beginning.

###  2. Condensation was caused by design, not damage

The problem came from:

- cold bridging,
- poor insulation,
- low internal temperatures.

These were **not** failures in repair — they were **original design defects**.

### 3. Landlords do NOT have to improve the property

Under s11 LTA 1985:

- landlords must **repair existing deterioration**,
- BUT do **not** need to upgrade the building,
- and do **not** have to solve structural condensation.

###  4. Mold caused by lifestyle vs building design

The court distinguished:

- **Deterioration-caused damp** → landlord responsible
- **Condensation caused by design or lifestyle** → landlord NOT responsible under s11

## Ratio
- Condensation and mold caused by the building’s structural design — not deterioration — do **not** amount to “disrepair” under s11 LTA 1985.  
- Landlords are not required to remedy inherent structural defects.
