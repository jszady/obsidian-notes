# Facts
- Mr Aslan granted Murphy the right to occupy a **basement room**.
- The written agreement stated:
    1. The occupier must **vacate the room every day from 9:30am–5:30pm**.
    2. The landlord retained a “right to share” the room.
    3. The parties described it as a **licence**.
- In reality:
    - The tenant **kept a lock and key**.
    - The landlord **never entered** the room.
    - The supposed sharing rights were never used.
    - The occupier treated it as his home.
    - and the tenant did not leave at the times he was supposed to it was not enforced 

## Issue
- Were the terms requiring Murphy to **leave for 8 hours every day**, and the “right to share,” genuine?  
- Or were they **pretenses** (sham clauses) designed to avoid creating a lease?

## Decision
- Court held:  
	- **These clauses were pretences. Murphy had a lease.**

## Reasoning
### 1. Pretence doctrine

- A clause is a **pretence** when it has an:
	 - **“Air of total unreality.”**

Meaning:

- It is inserted only to defeat tenant rights,
- It does not reflect the true intentions of the parties,
- It is never intended to be acted upon.

- The 9:30–5:30 rule clearly met this standard.

###  2. Exclusive possession in reality

- Murphy had control of the room.
- He had the key; landlord never entered.
- The forced-vacate hours were inconsistent with normal residential use.

###  3. Distinguish from genuine clauses (e.g., [[Marchant v Charters]])

- If a landlord **genuinely** provides cleaning or attendance, that destroys exclusive possession.  
- But here, the clause was **fake**.

###  4. Substance over form

- Calling it a “licence” has no legal effect (following [[Street v Mountford]]).

## Ratio

- **Sham clauses (“pretences”) inserted to avoid granting a lease must be disregarded.**  
- The court looks at the **true bargain**, not the written label or fake terms.
