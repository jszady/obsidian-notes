# Facts

- A wife claimed a right to remain in her husband’s house after he left. The husband’s creditor sought possession.
## Issue

- Was the wife’s right to stay a property right that could bind the bank?
## Decision

- No – her right was purely personal.
## Reasoning

- Only rights recognised by law as property rights can bind third parties.
- The wife’s “deserted wife’s equity” wasn’t a property right in law.
## Ratio

- To bind future owners, a right must be a recognised **property right**; personal rights don’t attach to land.
#### Exam use 

- Clarifies distinction between **personal and property rights**.
