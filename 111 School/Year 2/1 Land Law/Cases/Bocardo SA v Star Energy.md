Case: Bocardo SA v Star Energy
Citation: [2011] 1 AC 280
Court: UK Supreme Court 
Year: 2011
Topics: #Land #Ownership #Subsurface

---
# Facts
- Star Energy drilled oil wells diagonally underneath Bocatdo's land without consent. The drilling took place hundreds of meters below the surface

## Issue

- Does the landowner's title to land extend underground, making Star Energy's drilling a trespass
## Decision

- Yes, Bocardo's ownership extended beneath the surface, and star energy has committed trespass

## Reasoning

- a landowner owns everything below the surface "as far as technology allows use or enjoyment"
- the drilling constituted a physical intruction onto Bocatdo's land
- Compensations was due even though the activity was far below ground

## Ratio

- land ownership extends below the surface to all depths usable by the owner, unauthorized underground activity's amount to trespassing
