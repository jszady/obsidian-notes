# Facts

- During world war 2 the defendant's house was evacuated due to danger from bombing 
- the claimant offered the defendant temporary use of a cottage
- the arrangement was informal friendly and made during an emergency
- the occupant had exclusive possession of the cottage 
- no rent was paid and the owner could end the arrangement whenever necessary

## Issue

- whether the occupier despite having exclusive possession had a lease or merely a license 
	-  Did the parties intend to create a legal, enforceable landlord–tenant relationship?

## Decision
- the court appeal held this was a license not a lease 

## Reasoning
### 1. **No intention to create legal relations**

- The arrangement was made in a **wartime emergency**, as a favour.
- It was **temporary** and motivated by compassion, not commerciality.
- No rent or formal terms were agreed.

### 2. **Exclusive possession is not always enough**

- This case establishes that **exclusive possession alone does NOT make a lease** if:
	- The parties were not making a legally binding arrangement
	- Occupation is based on friendship, family, generosity, or emergency
- This is one of the **two major exceptions** in [[Street v Mountford]].

### 3. **Occupier cannot acquire rights against the will of the owner**

- Since the owner intended a temporary, informal arrangement, the occupier cannot turn it into a lease just because he had exclusive possession.

## Ratio

- A lease cannot exist without an **intention to create legal relations**, even where exclusive possession is present.
