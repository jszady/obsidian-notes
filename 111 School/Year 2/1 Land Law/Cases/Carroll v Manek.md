# Facts
-  Mr Manek owned a hotel.
- The claimant (Carroll) worked at the hotel.
- As part of his employment, he lived **in a room at the hotel**.
- He had **exclusive possession** of the room.
- The employer claimed the occupation was part of the employment package.
- After the employment ended, the occupier argued he had a **lease**, meaning he could remain.

## Issue
- Was Carroll’s occupation of the room a **lease** or a **service occupancy** (licence linked to employment)?
	- Does exclusive possession by an employee create a lease?
## Decision
- **The Court of Appeal held that it was a service occupancy — NOT a lease.**
- Carroll had to vacate when the employment ended.

## Reasoning
###  1. Occupation was **essential to employment duties**

- Carroll needed to live on-site to perform management tasks.
- His living there was for the **better performance of his job**.

###  2. Service occupancy automatically creates a licence

If the purpose of the occupation is:
- to perform employment duties
- and occupation is required for those duties
	- then **no tenancy** arises.

###  3. Exclusive possession does not override employment purpose

- Even though he had exclusive possession (his own room), it was **subordinate** to the employment relationship.
- This makes Carroll v Manek one of the recognized **exceptions to the Street v Mountford test**.

## Ratio
- If occupation is **required** for the better performance of employment, it creates a **service occupancy**, which is a **licence**, not a lease.  
- Exclusive possession does not change this.
