# Facts
- The defendant occupied a room in a house.
- The landlord provided **cleaning**, changed bed linen, and entered the room regularly.
- Occupier had **private use** of the room but shared other facilities.
- Agreement was described as a **licence**.
- The claimant argued that the arrangement **did not grant exclusive possession**.

## Issue
- Does the landlord’s provision of **regular attendance and cleaning services** prevent the occupier from having **exclusive possession**, and therefore prevent a **lease** from arising?

## Decision
- The Court of Appeal held that the occupier was a **licensee**, **not a tenant**.

## Reasoning

### 1. The landlord retained a **degree of control**

- Frequent entry to clean and maintain the room.
- This was not occasional access — it was **part of the arrangement**.

###  2. True purpose: **to provide attendance**, not to grant control of premises

The accommodation was more like:

- a hotel
- lodging with services
- a boarding arrangement

In such cases, courts do **not** recognise exclusive possession.

###  3. Exclusive possession must be _real_, not theoretical

- Even if a room is private, if the landlord’s rights of entry are **substantial and genuine**, exclusive possession does not exist.

###  4. Contrast with _pretence clauses_

- Unlike in [[Antoniades v Villiers]], the cleaning terms here were **real and genuine**, not fake.
## Ratio
- > A person does **not** have exclusive possession where the landlord provides **substantial attendance or services** requiring regular access to the premises.
