# Facts
- A couple (Mr Villiers and Ms Bridger) wanted to rent a **small attic flat** from Mr Antoniades.
- The landlord made them sign **two separate agreements** — each labelled a **“licence.”**
- Each agreement contained terms saying:
    - the landlord could **share the flat** with them at any time,
    - the arrangement created **no tenancy**,
    - rent must be paid individually.
- The flat was **so small** that it was physically impossible for anyone else to live there.
- The couple moved in on the **same day**, lived as a couple, and occupied the flat jointly.
- **In reality:**
    - The landlord **never tried to share** the flat.
    - The clause was never enforced.
    - The couple were treated as a single household.

## Issue
- Did the two separate “licence” agreements — containing a “right to share” — prevent the creation of a **joint tenancy**?

- Or were these clauses **pretences** designed to avoid a lease?

## Decision
The House of Lords held:

- The “right to share” clause was a **pretence**.
- The two agreements formed **one joint lease**.
- The couple had **exclusive possession** of the flat.

## Reasoning
### 1. Pretence doctrine

Terms inserted purely to avoid granting a lease — but never intended to be acted on — are **ignored**.

The right-to-share clause had an **air of total unreality**:

- the flat was too small
- landlord never entered
- landlord never attempted to share  
     therefore: **sham clause**.

###  2. Joint tenancy existed

The couple satisfied all **four unities**:

- **Unity of Possession** – shared the whole flat together
- **Unity of Interest** – same rights/duration
- **Unity of Title** – agreements interdependent
- **Unity of Time** – both moved in same day

###  3. Substance > form

- Label “licence” is irrelevant — following **[[Street v Mountford]]**.

### ✔️ 4. Contrast with _AG Securities v Vaughan_

In _Vaughan_:

- occupiers sign at different times
- no unity of time
- no joint control  
    - therefore **licences**
    

In _Antoniades_:

- couple moved in together
- functioned as a single household  
    -  **joint tenancy**

## Ratio
- When the true circumstances show a joint grant of exclusive possession, and landlord-inserted terms (like “right to share”) are pretences, the occupiers acquire a **joint lease**, not licences.
