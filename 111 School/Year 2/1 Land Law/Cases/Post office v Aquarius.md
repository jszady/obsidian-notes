# Facts
- The Post Office leased commercial premises from Aquarius.
- Issues arose involving the **condition of the property**, specifically relating to the building’s structure.
- Tenant argued the landlord had a duty under the repairing covenant to fix problems.
- The question became:  
	- **What counts as “disrepair”?**  
    - Does it include _inherent structural issues_, or only deterioration?

## Issue
- Does “disrepair” require the property to have fallen from a **previous better condition**, or can it include **original design defects**?

## Decision
- The Court of Appeal held:
	- “Disrepair” requires **deterioration** from an earlier state.
	- A property that is poorly designed or inherently defective is **not in disrepair** — it is simply badly built.

## Reasoning
### 1. Disrepair = deterioration

- The court defined “disrepair” as:
	-  “A deterioration from a prior physical condition.”

- If something:

	- breaks,
	- wears out,
	- decays,
	- becomes damaged,
-  that is disrepair.

### 2. No liability for inherent defects

If the property was:

- badly designed from the start,
- poorly ventilated,
- subject to condensation due to structure,

-  this is **not** disrepair.

- This is the same principle later applied in **[[Quick v Taff-Ely BC]]**.

###  3. Repair ≠ improvement

A landlord is not obliged to:

- upgrade the building,
- make it better than it was,
- cure design faults,
- correct poor ventilation or insulation.

- They must only **restore deterioration**.

## Ratio

- “Disrepair” under a repairing covenant requires a **worsening** from a previous physical condition.  
- The landlord has no duty to fix **inherent structural defects**, only deterioration.
