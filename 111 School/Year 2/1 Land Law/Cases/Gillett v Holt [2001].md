---
# Facts
- Mr. Holt repeatedly promised his farm worker, Mr. Gillett, that he would inherit his property. Gillett relied on this and worked for low pay for years, but Holt later changed his will.

## Issue

- Could Gillett claim rights in the land under proprietary estoppel?
## Decision

- Yes – Gillett was entitled to a share in the property.
## Reasoning

- There was a **clear promise**, **reliance**, and **detriment**.
- It would be unfair for Holt to go back on his word.
## Ratio

- When someone relies on a promise about land and suffers detriment, equity can create a **property right** through **proprietary estoppel**.
#### Exam use 
- Defines **elements of proprietary estoppel** (assurance, reliance, detriment).
