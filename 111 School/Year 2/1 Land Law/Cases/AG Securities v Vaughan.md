# Facts
- AG Securities owned a four-bedroom flat.
- The landlord granted **separate agreements** to **four occupiers**, each occupying a room.
- Crucially:
    - They **did not move in at the same time**.
    - They **signed separate contracts** on totally different dates.
    - They **did not know each other** beforehand.
    - Their agreements were **not interdependent**.
- They shared common areas (kitchen, bathroom, living room).
- Agreements labelled the occupiers as **licensees**.
- Occupiers argued they had a **joint tenancy**, giving them stronger rights.

## Issue
Did the four occupiers hold:
- a **joint lease** (requiring the four unities)?  
    or
- **four separate licences**?

To have a **joint tenancy**, they must have:

1. Unity of **Possession**
2. Unity of **Interest**
3. Unity of **Title**
4. Unity of **Time**

## Decision
The House of Lords held:

- They did **not** have a joint tenancy.
- They were **licensees**, not tenants.
- There was **no exclusive possession collectively**.

## Reasoning
### 1. **No unity of time**

- The occupiers arrived **months apart**.
- A joint tenancy requires **all interests to start simultaneously**.
- This alone made it impossible for the group to be joint tenants.

###  2. **No unity of title**

- They signed **independent agreements**, not one collective agreement.

###  3. **No intention to grant collective rights**

- Landlord never intended to treat them as a single household.
- Each person’s agreement was a **separate personal agreement**.

###  4. **Shared occupation ≠ exclusive possession**

- In a shared flat, you only get exclusive possession if the group **acts together as a single tenant**.
- Here, they were **strangers brought in individually**, not a unified group.

###  5. Distinguish from **[[Antoniades v Villiers]]**

In _Antoniades_:

- Couple moved in on SAME DAY
- Agreements were interdependent
- They clearly lived as ONE UNIT  
	-  Joint tenancy

In _Vaughan_:

- Different dates
- Separate agreements
- No unity of time  
	- No joint tenancy

## Ratio
- Multi-occupancy will only create a **joint tenancy** if all four unities are present.  
- Where occupiers enter **under separate agreements at different times**, they do not have collective exclusive possession and are **licensees**, not tenants.
