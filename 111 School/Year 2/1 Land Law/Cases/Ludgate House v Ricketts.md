# Facts

- A large office building (“Ludgate House”) was due for redevelopment.
- The owner entered a contract with a **property guardian company** (Global Guardians).
- Guardians (including Ricketts) lived in parts of the building.
- The agreement labelled them “**licensees**.”
- Their presence was intended to **reduce squatting/vandalism**, not to provide long-term housing.
- Guardians were not allowed to choose their room permanently; they could be **moved at any time**.
- The company kept substantial control over:
    - access
    - room allocation
    - rules about occupation
    - security duties
- Ricketts claimed he had **exclusive possession**, meaning he was a tenant.
## Issue
- Did the guardians have a **lease** (exclusive possession), or were they mere **licensees** under a **service occupancy–type arrangement**?
	- Does occupation for the **purpose of building security** prevent exclusive possession from arising?

## Decision
- The Court of Appeal held that the guardians were **licensees**, not tenants.
## Reasoning
### 1. Occupation’s **primary purpose** = **security**, not residential letting

- Guardians were allowed in the building primarily to **protect the property**.
- Their residential occupation was **secondary** and subordinate to that purpose.
- This is similar to a **service occupancy**, where occupation exists _only_ to perform duties.

###  2. No genuine exclusive possession

Guardians could be:

- moved between rooms
- limited in where they could go
- subject to strict rules
- required to vacate parts of the building at short notice

This level of **control** made it incompatible with exclusive possession.

### ✔️ 3. Nature of building (commercial office) made a lease unlikely

- This is not a normal residential arrangement → reinforces that the occupation did not create a tenancy.

### ✔️ 4. Intention of the parties was non-residential

- Not in the [[Booker v Palmer]] sense of “no legal relations,”  
- but because the **commercial purpose** was **security**, not housing.

## Ratio
- Where occupation is granted for the **primary purpose of securing or managing the property**, and not to give the occupier residential rights, it is a **licence**, not a lease.  
- Heavy control over occupation and mobility of rooms defeats exclusive possession.
