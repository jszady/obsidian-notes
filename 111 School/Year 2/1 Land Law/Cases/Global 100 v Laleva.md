# Facts
- Property guardian company (“Global 100”) placed Ms Laleva in a room within a building.
- Agreement labelled her a **“licensee.”**
- Clauses stated:
    - she had **no exclusive possession**,
    - the operator could **move her to another room**,
    - the operator retained control over building access.
- In reality:
    
    - Laleva **had her own locked room**,
    - she **was never moved**,
    - no one else entered her room,
    - she treated it as her **private residential accommodation**.
- The building was not actively used for commercial purposes and resembled shared residential units.

## Issue
- Were the clauses that denied exclusive possession **genuine**, or were they **pretences**?
	- Did Laleva have exclusive possession, making her a **tenant**, despite the “guardian licence” label?

## Decision
- The Court of Appeal held:
	- The “no exclusive possession” statements were **pretences**.
	- Laleva had **exclusive possession of her room**.
	- Therefore she had a **lease**, not a licence.

## Reasoning

### 1. Court looks at **reality**, not contractual wording

Even though the written agreement rejected exclusive possession, the court asked:

- Was she ever moved? → **No**
- Did anyone else enter her room? → **No**
- Did she have sole control of the room? → **Yes**
- Was a key given? → **Yes**

- This shows **actual exclusive possession**.

###  2. Clauses allowing relocation were **not genuine**

- Unlike in **[[Dresden Estates v Collinson]]**, where mobility was real,  
- here the clause was **never used** **pretence**.

###  3. Guardian scheme operated like residential letting

The guardians lived like tenants:

- private bedrooms
- communal facilities
- fixed monthly payments

This made the arrangement indistinguishable from a normal tenancy.

### 4. Contrast with **[[Ludgate House v Ricketts]]**

- In _Ludgate_, the purpose was **security** → genuine control → licence
- In _Laleva_, the purpose was **simply to fill empty rooms** → residential → lease
## Ratio
- Clauses denying exclusive possession, or allowing the operator to move the occupier, are **pretences** when never acted on.  
- An occupier with real control over a room has **exclusive possession**, creating a **lease**, even in a “guardian” scheme.
