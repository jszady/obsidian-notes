# Facts

- Mr Street owned a house divided into rooms.
- He granted Mrs Mountford the right to occupy **two rooms**.
- Agreement **labelled** a “licence,” intended to avoid giving her tenant protections.
- She had **exclusive possession** of her unit (he had no genuine right of entry).
- She paid weekly rent — functioning like a tenancy.
	- Context nuance:
		- This case involved **one occupier with one self-contained unit**.
		- This is important: when a person controls **one room/flat**, the Street rule applies strongly.
		- For multi-occupancy/shared spaces, courts use [[AG Securities v Vaughan]] and [[Antoniades v Villiers ]] to refine analysis.
## Issue

- Is the agreement a **lease** or a **licence**, despite the label?
## Decision

- **Lease**, not a licence.
## Reasoning

### 1. **Exclusive possession = lease**

- A person with exclusive possession for a term receives a lease unless an exception applies.

###  2. **Labels are irrelevant**

- Calling it a “licence” cannot change the true nature of the agreement.

### 3. **Term certain requirement satisfied**

- Weekly rent created a **weekly periodic tenancy** → qualifies as a “term of years absolute” under [[LPA 1925]] s205(1)(xxvii).

###  4. **Exceptions rejected**

Two exceptions where exclusive possession ≠ lease:

- No intention to create legal relations → [[Booker v Palmer]]
- Service occupancy → [[Carroll v Manek]]

Neither applied.
## Ratio

- **Exclusive possession + term certain = lease**, unless a recognized exception applies.  
- Courts assess **substance over form**.
#### Exam use 

- Defines **test for leasehold estates**.
