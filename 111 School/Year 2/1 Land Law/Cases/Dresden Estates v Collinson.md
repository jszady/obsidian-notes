# Facts
- A person occupied a room under an agreement stating the landlord could:  
    **“move the occupier to different rooms within the building at any time.”**
- The occupier claimed **exclusive possession**, arguing it was a lease.
- The landlord maintained it was a **licence**, pointing to the **mobility clause**

## Issue
- Does a **mobility clause** allowing the landlord to relocate the occupier at will prevent exclusive possession and therefore prevent a lease from arising?

## Decision
- Court held: **This was a licence, not a lease.**
- The mobility clause **destroyed exclusive possession**.

## Reasoning

### 1. Mobility clause gives landlord **continuing control**

- Exclusive possession means the occupier can exclude the landlord.
- But if the landlord can **move** you between rooms, you **cannot** exclude them from “your” space.

###  2. Exclusive possession must be real, not theoretical

- Occupier did not have stable control over a specific space.
- This is incompatible with the Street test.

###  3. Clause was genuine, not a pretence

Contrast:

- **Genuine mobility clause** → licence (this case)
- **Fake/sham clause** → lease (see [[Antoniades v Villiers]] and [[Aslan v Murphy]]

###  4. The purpose of occupation resembled “managed accommodation”

- Rooms could be reassigned as needed → more like a hostel/boarding arrangement.
## Ratio
- A landlord’s **genuine power to relocate the occupier** at any time prevents exclusive possession and creates a **licence**, not a lease.
