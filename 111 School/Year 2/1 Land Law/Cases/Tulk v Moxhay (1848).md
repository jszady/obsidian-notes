# Facts

- A landowner sold land in Leicester Square with a promise that it would remain an open garden. Later buyers were told about the promise but wanted to build.
## Issue

- Can a restrictive covenant bind later purchasers of land even if they weren’t part of the original contract?
## Decision

- Yes – if the buyer had notice of the covenant, it binds them in equity.

## Reasoning

- Equity enforces promises that “touch and concern” the land.
- Later owners who buy with notice are bound by the covenant.

## Ratio

- A **restrictive covenant** can bind later owners as an **equitable property right** if it benefits other land and the buyer had notice.

#### Exam use 

- Introduced **restrictive covenants** as a recognised equitable interest.
