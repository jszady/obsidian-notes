	- The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.’ – Anatole France, Le Lys Rouge (1898)
- Feminism 
	- The person of the law was constructed as gender neutral. … What emerges in the context of the modern liberal order is a gender neutral subject of law. Gender was formally wiped from the subjectivity of the legal subject.’ J. Conaghan & Y. Russell 2015: 208
		- when we we try to making things "neutral" we are mostly doing it for men
	- ‘[T]he fact that the masculine in law has been universalised and appears under the guise of impartiality and neutrality means that women’s perspectives are understood not as equally universal but as particular, biased, special interests, not providing the degree of objectivity required for authoritative judgement.’ R. Hunter 2013: 15
