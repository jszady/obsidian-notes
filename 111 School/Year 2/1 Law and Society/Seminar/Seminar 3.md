### Questions 

- Question 1 
	- Health is not just about disease; it is tied to _freedom and social justice_. Thomson notes that health inequalities track wider social inequalities in power, income, housing, education and work. When health is unequally distributed, so are people’s real opportunities to live a flourishing life.
	- Marmot (quoted by Thomson) describes health as a _“measure of social and economic progress”_: when societies are unequal, health outcomes are also unequal.
	- Hiam et al argue that health in the UK is “going in the wrong direction” and that worsening health is avoidable if we address the social determinants. This makes inequities a matter of _avoidable harm_ rather than “natural” differences.
	- So we should care about health inequities because they are: (1) unjust (they track unfair social structures); (2) avoidable; and (3) politically informative, telling us something is wrong with how resources and opportunities are organised.
- Question 2
	- **Between countries**
		- Thomson notes that in 2016 there was a _30+ year_ gap in life expectancy between the richest countries (eg Japan, Switzerland) and the poorest (eg Lesotho, Central African Republic).
		- These differences are tied to global inequalities in wealth, education, working conditions, exposure to conflict, and access to health systems, not biological differences.
	- **Within countries**
		- Thomson emphasises that even in high-income states with universal systems like the NHS, there are large internal inequalities. Health “varies in magnitude and correlates with social inequality”; countries with greater social/economic inequality have greater health disparities.
		- In England (2020–22), life expectancy at birth differed by **10.7 years for men** and **8.5 years for women** between the most and least deprived areas. Healthy life expectancy gaps are even larger (around **19–20 years**).
	- **The gradient**
		- Thomson, drawing on Marmot and others, talks about a _social gradient_: health outcomes “line up on a steady slope from the have-leasts to the have-mosts”, not just a gap between the very poorest and everyone else.
		- The idea of a gradient is helpful because it shows:
		    - Health improves at _each step_ up the social ladder.
			- Inequities are _system-wide_, not just about a small “underclass”.
		    - Policy must address the _entire distribution_ (e.g. taxation, education, housing), not just a residual “most deprived” group.
- Question 3
	- **Life expectancy and deprivation**: In England (2020–22) there is a **10.7-year male** and **8.5-year female** life expectancy gap between the most and least deprived tenth of areas. For _healthy_ life expectancy the gap is around **19–20 years**.
	- **Region**: Recent analyses show the lowest life expectancy in the **North East and North West**, while the four most southerly regions are above the England average, confirming a persistent _north–south_ divide.
	- **Proportion of life in good health**: Women in the poorest parts of England and Wales are now expected to spend only about **two-thirds** of their lives in good health, compared with over **80%** in the wealthiest areas.
	- **Cause-specific inequalities**:
	    - Cancer death rates are around **60% higher** in the most deprived UK areas, with lung cancer deaths nearly _three times_ higher.
	    - People in the most deprived 20% of areas are nearly _twice_ as likely to be hospitalised with infectious diseases as those in the least deprived areas.
	- **Gender and “deaths of despair”**: Men die on average about four years younger than women; deaths from substance misuse, alcohol and suicide are several times higher in deprived areas.
	- **Overall picture:** health in England is _unequally distributed_ along lines of class, region, ethnicity and gender, with the sharpest disadvantages concentrated in deprived communities. This fits precisely with the SDH account in Thomson and the call for structural action in Hiam et al.
- Question 4
	- **Definition**
		- Social determinants of health (SDH) are the _social, economic, environmental and political conditions_ in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and the distribution of power, money and resources that shape those conditions. Thomson emphasises that consistent correlations between these social arrangements and health outcomes leave “little room for doubt” that they account for a significant fraction of population health.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- **Three example “lists” from the literature (all cited by Thomson)**
	1. **Wilkinson & Marmot – _The Solid Facts_ (WHO 1999)**
	    - Lists ten key determinants: **socioeconomic status, stress, early life, social exclusion, work, unemployment, social support, addiction, food, and transport**.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	2. **WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health – _Closing the Gap in a Generation_ (2008)**
	    - Groups determinants under:
	        - **Daily living conditions** – healthy physical environments, fair employment and decent work, social protection, access to health care.
	        - **Power, money and resources** – health equity as a goal, fair public financing, market responsibility, gender equity, political empowerment, good global governance.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	3. **Marmot ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’ / later Marmot reviews**
	    - Identify domains across the life-course: early childhood development, education, employment and working conditions, income and social protection, built environment and communities, and access to health care. Hiam et al rely heavily on Marmot’s framework in arguing that the NHS and wider society must tackle these domains together.[UCL Discovery+1](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10195557?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Together these show that health is shaped far more by _social organisation_ than by clinical care alone.
- Question 5
	- Healthcare (including public health services) is itself _one social determinant_, but not the only or even the main driver of population health. Thomson stresses that health inequalities persist even in countries with universal systems like the NHS, showing that improving health care alone cannot remove inequities produced by education, income, housing and work.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- The WHO Commission and Marmot’s work emphasise that access to health care belongs under “daily living conditions”, alongside employment, housing and social protection.[White Rose Research Online+1](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- Daniels argues that healthcare is “special” because it protects normal functioning and the range of opportunities, but he also insists that justice requires fair distribution of the _wider_ determinants (education, income, etc.), not just healthcare.[PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11951872/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- So within the SDH framework, we should see healthcare as:
	    - **Necessary but insufficient** for health justice; and
	    - Dependent on, and interacting with, other determinants (e.g., primary care access shaped by transport, employment, immigration status).
- Question 6
	- **Yes – law is a determinant of health.**
		- Thomson builds on the Lancet–O’Neill Commission, which identifies four _legal determinants of health_:
		    1. Law to translate vision into action (eg SDGs; Universal Health Coverage).
		    2. Law to govern national and global health institutions.
		    3. Law to implement fair, evidence-based interventions.
		    4. Building _legal capacity_ for health.[White Rose Research Online+1](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- Thomson argues we must go further and foreground law’s role in shaping _social inequalities_ and the distribution of resources – e.g. labour law, housing law, social security, immigration rules – which then structure exposure to SDH.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- **Pathways where law impacts health**  
		- You can think of at least three scales:
			- **Macro (structural)**:
			    - Constitutional and fiscal rules, social security regimes, housing regulations, employment protections, environmental law. These shape income distribution, job security, housing quality and pollution exposure.
	- **Meso (institutional/sectoral)**:
	    - Laws governing the NHS and public health powers, equality duties on public bodies, regulatory standards for workplaces, schools, food and alcohol.
	- **Micro (individual)**:
	    - Anti-discrimination law, family law, immigration/asylum decisions, criminalisation of certain behaviours. These affect individual trajectories, stigma and access to services.
	- **Why “justice” (Daniels) helps**
		- Daniels links health inequalities to _fair equality of opportunity_: unjust health inequalities are those arising from unfair social arrangements (education, work, income, etc.).[PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11645876/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Referencing justice helps frame law not just as a technical toolkit but as a means of:
	    - **Redistributing** the social determinants of health;
	    - **Constraining** harmful practices (e.g., discriminatory policing, exploitative work);
	    - **Creating accountability** for governments that fail to reduce avoidable health inequalities.
	- So yes, law is clearly a determinant of health; talking about _scale_ and _justice_ clarifies how.
- Question 7
	- Hiam et al argue that blaming individuals for poor health (“lifestyle choices”) and attacking structural policies as “nanny state” miss the fact that health is socially produced.[UCL Discovery+1](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10195557?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Vulnerability theory (e.g. Fineman) would support their argument by saying:
		- **Vulnerability is universal and constant**: all humans are inherently vulnerable to illness, dependency and harm over the life course. The question is not _whether_ people are vulnerable, but how social institutions _distribute and manage that vulnerability_.
	- **The state can’t be “neutral”**: laws and policies already shape who is more exposed to harm (e.g. through housing, work, social security). Doing nothing is itself a political choice that leaves some groups systematically more vulnerable.
	- **State responsibility is to build resilience, not to micromanage individuals**: “Nanny state” rhetoric suggests the state is over-reaching into private choices. Vulnerability theory reframes this: the state’s job is to structure conditions (income support, safe housing, decent work, education) so that individuals and communities are _resilient_ in the face of unavoidable risks.
	- So you could say to Hiam et al: vulnerability theory provides a normative backbone for your argument. It shows why structural, whole-of-society action on SDH is not paternalism but a legitimate response to shared human vulnerability and unequal resilience.
- Question 8 
	- **Why it _is_ a strong example:**
		- Health inequities show **patterned vulnerability**: the same groups (poorer communities, racialised minorities, women in precarious work, disabled people) experience worse outcomes across multiple conditions and life stages. This matches vulnerability theory’s focus on how institutions and power distribute risk and resilience.[White Rose Research Online+1](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- The COVID-19 experience in the UK, which Thomson discusses, is a vivid example: despite a universal NHS, mortality and morbidity were much higher in deprived and racialised communities, demonstrating that underlying social structures, not just viruses or individual behaviour, determine who suffers most.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- Vulnerability theory helps:
	    - Reject simplistic lifestyle/individual responsibility narratives;
	    - Highlight the _positive obligations_ of the state to restructure institutions and resources;
	    - Frame health inequities as evidence of broader social injustice (as Thomson, Marmot, and Daniels all suggest).[White Rose Research Online+2PubMed+2](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- **Possible weaknesses / limits revealed by this example:**
		- **Action-guidance**: Vulnerability theory is very good at diagnosis (“these structures produce unequal vulnerability”) but often less precise about _which_ concrete reforms should be prioritised, and how to trade off competing claims when resources are scarce. Daniels’ work tries to fill this gap with a more detailed justice framework and “accountability for reasonableness”.[ResearchGate+1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23685541_Not_so_special_after_all_Daniels_and_the_social_determinants_of_health?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Level of abstraction**: If used alone, “vulnerability” language can become so broad that it risks flattening important differences (e.g. race, gender, migration status) instead of analysing specific mechanisms of racism, sexism, ableism, etc. Thomson’s emphasis on intersectional, racialised inequalities in COVID suggests we still need more concrete accounts of power and discrimination.[White Rose Research Online](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/190145/3/Legal%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript%20-%202022.pdf)
	- **Agency and resistance**: Some critics worry that framing people primarily as “vulnerable” can underplay their agency and collective resistance (e.g. trade unions, social movements), which are crucial for changing the social determinants of health.
	- So: yes, health inequities are a powerful example for vulnerability analysis—but the example also shows why we need to combine vulnerability with more detailed theories of justice, power and political economy.
- Question 9
