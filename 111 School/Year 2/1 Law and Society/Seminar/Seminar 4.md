- Question 1
	- ## **Suspicion-based stop & search**
		- **Main one: PACE s.1 (Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984)**  
			- Police can stop/search if they have **reasonable suspicion** that a person has:
				- stolen goods
				- offensive weapons
				- drugs
				- items to commit crime
	- **Why this type is controversial**
		- **Reasonable suspicion is vague** — officers often rely on “hunches” affected by stereotypes.
		- **Disproportionality** — Black people searched far more often (repeated in Home Office reports).
		- **Low effectiveness** — very small arrest/contraband rate.
		- Still intrusive and humiliating even with legal safeguards.
	- ## **Suspicionless stop & search**
		- ### **s.60 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994**
			- Senior officer authorises searches **in anticipation of violence**.
			- Can stop **anyone**, **no suspicion required**.
			- Purpose: find weapons, prevent serious violence.
	- ### **s.44 Terrorism Act 2000 (replaced by s.47A)**
		- Allowed police to stop/search **any person or vehicle** in an authorised area.
		- No suspicion needed.
		- Used heavily after 9/11 and the London attacks.
	- **Evidence from PDF:**  
		- Use peaked around 2008–09 at:
		- **Over 150,000 searches** under s.60
		- **Over 200,000 searches** under s.44
	- ## **Why suspicionless powers are controversial**
		- ### **(a) They violate rule of law principles**
			- Rule of law = state power must be constrained by clear criteria.
			- Suspicionless powers give **wide, unfettered discretion** → risk of arbitrary policing.
			- ECtHR ruled s.44 **not “in accordance with law”** under Article 8.
		- ### **b) Massive racial disproportionality**
			- Black people were **up to 28 times more likely** to be stopped under s.60.
		- ### **(c) Almost zero effectiveness**
			- Lord Carlile repeatedly stated **no terrorism arrests** from s.44.
		- ### **(d) Severe community damage**
			- Young Black men felt targeted → distrust, alienation, trauma.
			- Stops happened for trivial reasons (photographers, protesters, trainspotters).
		- ### **(e) Used beyond their legal purpose**
			- s.44 used to manage **ordinary protest**, not terrorism.
			- s.60 used as general “aggressive policing” tool during knife-crime panic.
- Question 2
	- # **Is an active State always a responsive State?” (Fineman + racism + stop & search)**
		- ## **Fineman basics (very simple)**
			- Everyone is **vulnerable** because we depend on social institutions.
			- A **responsive state** should distribute resources fairly to help people build **resilience**.
			- The state fails when its institutions create **inequality**, not resilience.
	- ## **Key idea**
		- The state being “active” ≠ the state being “responsive”.
		- Stop & search proves this.
	- ### **Why?**
		- Stop & search is a form of **active state intervention**—highly intrusive.
		- But its effects **reduce resilience** for racialised communities (especially Black communities) by:
		    - increasing fear
		    - lowering trust
		    - producing criminalisation
		    - reinforcing stereotypes
		    - discouraging cooperation with police
	- ## **How stop & search shows institutional racism**
		- **Disproportionality** = evidence of institutional bias.
		- Reasonable suspicion often rests on **racialised assumptions**.
			- Suspicionless searches amplify structural racism because officers rely on “professional intuition” which is affected by stereotypes.
	- ## **Conclusion**
		- The state is **active** through policing.
		- But it is _not_ **responsive**, because it worsens vulnerability and reduces resilience, especially for Black and minority communities.
- Question 3 
	- ## **(1) Structural injustices for neurodivergent people in the criminal legal system**
		- **Communication barriers** → misunderstanding police instructions → escalation.
		- Behaviours misread as “suspicious”, “non-compliant”, “aggressive”.
		- Lack of adapted procedures = unfair risk of arrest.
		- Prison and court systems not designed for sensory/processing differences.
		- Neurodivergent people over-policed and under-supported.
	- ## **(2) Structural injustices in stop & search**
		- ### **(a) Highly discretionary powers**
			- Broad discretion = racialised outcomes.
			- “Reasonable suspicion” built on police culture, not neutrality.
		- ### **(b) Police culture (habitus)**
			- Officers rely on “common sense” assumptions: who looks criminal, who looks dangerous.
			- These assumptions reflect societal racism.
		- ### **(c) Political environment**
			- Knife-crime and terrorism panics justified mass searches of Black and Asian communities.
		- ### **(d) Very low arrest rates**
			- Shows power used symbolically, not effectively.
		- ### **(e) Community harm**
			- Damages trust → less willingness to report crime → worsens safety.
- Question 4
	- **Area:** Criminal law  
		- **Vulnerable subject:** Criminal defendant
		- **Risks:** Power imbalance, detention, coercive pleading, racial bias, mental health misunderstandings.
		- **Structures hindering resilience:** Stop & search discrimination, remand overuse, legal-aid cuts, mandatory sentences, complex procedures.
		- **Structures supporting resilience:** Legal representation, PACE rights, burden of proof, disclosure rules.
		- **What a responsive state would do:**  
			- Reduce discrimination, increase legal aid, adapt procedures for neurodivergence, divert people to services, expand bail support, strengthen oversight.
