## Questions 

- Question 1
	- **Rational**
		- Makes decisions logically, unaffected by emotion
		- Reason > emotion (emotion seen as irrational / feminine)
	 - **Autonomous & Independent**
		- Self-sufficient
		- Not dependent on others for care or survival
		- Ignores social relationships (like family roles, caregiving)
	- **Abstract / Universal / Neutral**
		- Treated as if all people experience the world the same way
		- Erases differences in gender, race, class, disability etc.
		- Pretends law is “objective” when it actually favours the dominant group
	-  **Self-Interested**
		- Focuses on individual rights, freedoms, and property
		- Atomised individualism — not collective responsibility    
	-  **Typically Modelled on a Male Norm**
		- Presented as gender-neutral, but is implicitly:
		    - white
		    - male
		    - economically secure
		    - able-bodied
	- Feminists argue this creates barriers for groups who don’t fit this norm
- Question 3 
	- Some distinctions are **legitimate and necessary** (e.g., age limits for voting/driving) to protect welfare and public safety.
	- **Formal equality** treats everyone the same, but law often needs **different treatment** to achieve real fairness (e.g., disability accommodations, maternity protections).
	- However, distinctions are judged against a **supposedly neutral legal subject** who is actually modelled on a **male, independent, rational norm** (Hunter).
	- This means that “neutral” rules can still **privilege dominant groups** and disadvantage those with different embodied or relational experiences (e.g., carers, prgnant women).
	- **Indirect discrimination** shows how facially neutral laws can produce unequal outcomes for women, racial minorities, or disabled people.
	- Distinctions that reflect **structural inequalities** or stereotypes (e.g., assumptions about women being dependants) are inherently discriminatory.
	- Feminist critiques argue that **power dynamics must be considered** — if a distinction reinforces social hierarchy, it cannot be dismissed as harmless differentiation.
	- Therefore, while **not every distinction** is discriminatory, the law must evaluate whether distinctions **entrench inequality** or **advance substantive equality**.
- Question 4 
	- Useful details a feminist lens highlights in _Ruxton v Lang
		- The facts: The accused (Fiona Lang) had been subject to domestic violence from her former partner (Callum Scott). She fled the house after he threatened her with a knife, then drove away while over the legal alcohol‐limit to reach a safe place. 
		- She raised the defence of **necessity** (or duress/escape) under the Road Traffic Act 1988 section 5(1)(a): driving with excess alcohol while in charge of a vehicle. 
		- The court, at sheriff level, accepted that she was in “reasonable fear for her life” when she left the house, but held that by the time she had driven for almost 2 miles the danger had “subsided” and thus the immediacy test for necessity was not satisfied. 
	    - A feminist perspective draws attention to how the legal test of “immediate danger” or “immediacy” is shaped by assumptions of a male normative scenario (sudden attack, stranger, single event) rather than the pattern of domestic violence (ongoing threat, control, fear) which women more often experience. See how feminist judgment rewriting emphasises that “immediacy” should be interpreted contextually considering the history of abuse.
		- Further, feminist analysis highlights how the court overlooked or minimally treated the **relational and embodied context** of her situation: her status as victim of domestic violence, her fear, the physical embodiment of the threat, her need to flee rather than comply with less dangerous options. These aspects are typically invisibilised in liberal legal reasoning which expects an autonomous individual in a neutral situation.
		- It also shows how the evidential standards (e.g., requiring injury, or limiting what counts as “danger”) may disadvantage victims of domestic abuse whose contexts differ from the “male norm”. Feminist work questions whether requiring a “knife attack” immediately before departure, or requiring the danger to continue in a narrow way, ignores the lived experience of coercive violence.
	-  How feminism can challenge liberal law’s account of itself via this case
		- Liberal law posits itself as **neutral**, treating all persons as autonomous, rational, equally situated, and subject to the same tests. But feminist critique points out that such tests often embed a **male default** (see Rosemary Hunter on the “male form” of the legal person) — thus the law isn’t neutral in effect.
		- Feminist analysis uses this case to show that the legal concept of “necessity” or “immediacy” is constructed around a scenario of a male confronting an immediate external threat, rather than a woman escaping an internal, ongoing threat. By pointing this out, feminism reveals the **hidden normative assumptions** in the law.
		- It also draws attention to **embodiment, relationality, power imbalances** (e.g., domestic violence victim’s position) which liberal law tends to ignore. This case illustrates that victims of certain forms of violence may lack options or alternatives that the idealised legal subject is assumed to have.
		- Feminism therefore can push for **substantive equality** (not just formal equality) — asking whether legal tests accommodate difference in experience, context, gendered power. This means law must adjust or reinterpret its tests to account for non-male bodies, for social realities like domestic abuse, caregiving, etc.
		- The feminist re-judgment or critique of the case shows that law could have taken a broader view of necessity, recognising that immediate danger might persist even when “attack” has paused, especially in a domestic context. That challenges the rigid application of immediate/immediacy tests.
		-  Finally, the case shows how feminist critique **makes visible** what is otherwise invisible (e.g., threat in domestic context, relational dependency, fear) and invites reform or reinterpretation of legal doctrine to be more inclusive.
	 -  Examples of invisibilising language in the case report
		- The phrase “immediate danger of life‐threatening or serious injury” is applied in a way that assumes a sudden physical attack scenario — that invisibilises ongoing threats or fear from past violence.
		- Reference to her driving “for almost two miles” before being pulled over; the court treated that as marking the danger had ceased — language treats the victim’s fear as less valid after a momentary escape, rather than recognising persisting fear.
		- The report may describe her as having “left the house” rather than emphasising that she was forced to flee because of a pattern of violence; the language positions her departure as voluntarily crossing the boundary of safety rather than being compelled by coercion.
		- The treatment of her fear as “reasonable” only up to a point, then requiring that the danger be “subsisting” at the material time of driving — the language draws a narrow line of “danger” rather than seeing the broader context of fear and threat.
		- Possibly the judgment uses neutral terms like “accused” rather than acknowledging her victim status and the power imbalance with the attacker; that invisibilises the gendered dynamic of domestic violence.
		- There may be lack of reference to “coercive control” or domestic abuse history; the language sticks to “history of violence” but doesn’t engage with how ongoing threat operates differently than a single incident — thus the lived experience is invisibilised.
    - What I would have expected to be addressed but wasn’t
		- I would expect the judgment to more fully **engage with the context of domestic violence**: the prior pattern of abuse, threat, fear, and how that affects what counts as “immediacy” for a victim.
		- I would expect analysis of the **alternatives available** to her (did she have to drive? were other safe options available?), and whether the legal test accounts for victims who may not have safe alternatives.
		- I would expect the court to address the **power imbalance** and gendered nature of the threat: that she was threatened by a male partner, in her home environment, which is qualitatively different from a neutral environment.
		- I would expect discussion about how the “reasonable person” test should be **contextualised** for victims of domestic violence (rather than the standard “reasonable man/ordinary person” test).
		- I would expect some reflection on how the **embodied experience** (fear, trauma, urgency) and structural position (victim of domestic violence) affect her decision to drive while over the legal limit — and whether the law’s regulatory purpose (deterring drunk driving) should yield in such extraordinary circumstances.
		- I would have liked to see discussion of **coercive control** or psychological threat as sufficient for “danger”, not only physical injury, which the judgment seems to treat narrowly.
		- Lastly, I would expect the judgment to consider whether the legal framework (necessity defence) is fit for purpose in domestic violence contexts, and whether doctrinal reform is needed — but apparently it sticks to the orthodox test.
