## Questions 
- Question 1
	- **Definition**
		- An **action for annulment** (under **Article 263 TFEU**) is a **judicial review procedure** that allows certain parties to challenge the **legality of EU acts** before the **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)**.
	- **Purpose**
		- It ensures that EU institutions **do not exceed their powers** — this is part of the **principle of legality** and **judicial control** over EU institutions.
	-  **Who can bring the action**
		- There are three main groups: 
			1. **Privileged applicants** – Member States, the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission.  
		    → They **always have standing**, no need to prove individual concern.
			2. **Semi-privileged applicants** – ECB, Court of Auditors, Committee of the Regions (only to protect their prerogatives).
			3. **Non-privileged applicants** – Individuals and companies (private applicants).
			    → Must meet **strict standing requirements** (see Q2).
    -  **Case against the Tobacco Directive**
		- The **case was brought by British American Tobacco (BAT) and Imperial Tobacco** challenging **Directive 2001/37/EC** (the Tobacco Advertising and Labelling Directive).
		- They argued it **exceeded the EU’s competence** under the internal market provisions (Art 114 TFEU).
		- This case clarified the **scope of Art 263** and showed that **large corporations** could challenge EU acts if they were **directly and individually concerned**.
- Question 2 
	- **Article 263(4) TFEU** (as reformed by the Lisbon Treaty) sets out the conditions for **non-privileged applicants (individuals, companies)**.
		- They can bring an action against:
			1. **An act addressed to them**, or
			2. **An act which is of direct and individual concern to them**, or
			3. **A regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures**.
- Question 3 
	- **Direct Concern**
		- Relatively **plausible** — if the EU act **directly applies** to the applicant without national discretion.  
		- Example: In _Microban_, the ban on a chemical directly prohibited the company from selling its product.
	-  **Individual Concern**
		- **Extremely difficult** to satisfy because of the _Plaumann test_. An applicant must show they are **uniquely distinguished** from all others affected — almost impossible if the act applies generally (e.g. to an entire industry).  → This is why the _Inuit_ case failed.
	- **Criticism:** Many scholars (including Rhimes) argue that this **restrictive test undermines access to justice** and contradicts the **rule of law** in the EU.
- Question 4
	- **(a) Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (T-18/10 & C-583/11)**
		- **Facts:** Inuit communities challenged an EU Regulation banning seal products, arguing it harmed their livelihoods.  
		- **Issue:** Could they bring a direct action under Art 263(4)?
		- **Held:**
			- The measure was a **legislative act** (adopted through co-decision), not a **regulatory act**, so the **Lisbon reform didn’t help**.
			- They were **not individually concerned**, as the Regulation applied to all seal product traders.
			- **Result:** Case dismissed — they lacked **standing**.
		- **Reasoning:** The CJEU said “regulatory act” means **non-legislative acts of general application**, not legislative ones.  → This interpretation made Art 263(4) reform **less effective**.
	- **(b) Microban International Ltd v Commission (T-262/10)**
		- **Facts:** Microban challenged a Commission decision banning a chemical (triclosan) used in their products.
		- **Held:**
			- The decision was a **regulatory act** (not legislative).
			- It was of **direct concern** (it immediately banned their product).
			- It **did not require any national implementing measures**.
			- Therefore, they had **standing**.
		- **Contrast:** Unlike _Inuit_, the act here directly targeted the company’s product and had immediate effect.
- Question 5 
	- **Short answer:** _No — not really._
		- **Rhimes’ Argument (Down the Rabbit Hole)**
			- The **Lisbon reform** (adding the third category: “regulatory acts of direct concern not entailing implementing measures”) was meant to **broaden access to justice** for individuals.
			- But the **CJEU’s narrow interpretation** in _Inuit_ **undermined** this goal.
			- He argues that the **Court protected its own docket control** instead of promoting accountability.
			- The result is a **“half-hearted reform”**: it helps in cases like _Microban_, but **most applicants** (especially NGOs and individuals) are still **locked out**.
			- Rhimes calls the standing rules a **“rabbit hole”** — complex, technical, and inconsistent with the principle of effective judicial protection.
- Question 6 
	- **Article 267 TFEU – Preliminary Reference Procedure**
		- It allows **national courts** to ask the **CJEU** for clarification on the **interpretation or validity** of EU law.
	- **Who can refer**
		- **Any national court or tribunal** of a Member State.
		- The applicant in a national case **does not have direct access** to the CJEU — they must **persuade the national court** to refer.
	-  **Types of reference**
		1. **Interpretation references** – asking how to interpret EU law.
		2. **Validity references** – questioning the validity of EU acts (an _indirect_ way to challenge legality).
	-  **Access to justice angle**
		- Even if individuals cannot challenge EU acts directly under **Art 263**, they can **indirectly** do so via **Art 267** by convincing a national court to refer a validity question.
