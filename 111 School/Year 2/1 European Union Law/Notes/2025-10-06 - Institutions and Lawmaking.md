## Quotes / Authorities
- hix 2.1 
	- the EU need not be a state to fulfill many of the traditional functions of government... the EU certainly  possesses all the classic characteristics of a political  system […]Executive, legislative and judicial powers are exercised ‘jointly’ by the EU institutions. Nevertheless,  instead of a classic ‘organic’ separation of powers into three different institutions, there is a ‘functional’ separation of powers across several institutions...’
-  Farrell and heretier 2.1 
	- ‘ the European Union is neither a standard democratic nation state, nor an intergovernmental organization, but  something in between. There is no “government” as such  in the European Union, with a party to support it in  Parliament; rather, there are fifteen governments, each  with specific mandates from their domestic population.’
